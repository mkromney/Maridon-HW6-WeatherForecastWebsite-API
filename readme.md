This homework contains a weather forecast. While I was unable to access a non-subscriber up-to-date hourly weather forecast, I was able to make a 5-day 3-hour forecast work here. This site has 4 main functional dynamic features: 
    1. A user can enter a city into the search bar and receive information about the local weather. 
    2. A user's search is saved in the local storage - which can be seen after refreshing a page. 
    3. The site offers a user the ability to clear the storage and start over. 
    4. The site has detailed information regarding temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon to help a user visualise the weather.

This time around I didn't have to search for very many resources outside of the class material, that being said, it was a tutor who helped me to interpret the critical for loop and the local storage parameters. I reverse engineered much of the last two weeks of class including Modules 1-6.

Thank you!
