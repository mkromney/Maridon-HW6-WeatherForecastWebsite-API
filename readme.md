 Homework 5: Simple JQuery Interactive Calendar

## Description & Functionality

This homework contains a simple interactive calendar with the following capabilities:
 1. Displays the current date.
 2. Displays time slots representing the hours of the regular work week: 09:00 to 17:00.
 3. The time slots change colours to indicate whether an hour time slot is in the past (grey), present (red) or future(green). 
 4. The time blocks allow a user to enter text into the time slot (such as an event, an appointment or a to-do list) and saves these entries via a "floppy save" icon button in local storage.

Thank you to the TAs, Jaytee and Nick for their help on this one. I was also assisted by Mila one of our tutors who helped me with the HTML hard-coding issues, the order of the URL links, and reminded me best practices for clearing class properties.
From the web I pulled inspiration from:
